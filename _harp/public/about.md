# About No2Bio

We are concerned citizens loosely coordinated via a mailing list since 2008.

If you need names, In our [Hebrew site](http://no2bio.org) there are videos
by **well known** professors and security experts strongly opposing the
Israeli "Biometric Databe Bill".

Some of us are publicly known because they have petitioned to the supreme court
against the state and got a ruling against the negligence of the state
(twice, and it's not over yet).

As for the identity of the rest of us? That's private ;)
